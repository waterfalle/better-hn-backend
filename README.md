# Better Hacker News Backend 🐈

## Description

This is the Flask backend for the frontend at [Better Hacker News](https://github.com/waterfalle/better-hn).

You can find more information at the link above.

The backend uses the **asyncio** library to asynchronously fetch the top 500 stories and their contents from the official Hacker News API (which can be found [here](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)).

The stories are updated every 5 minutes to ensure that everything is up-to-date.
